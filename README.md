# Needy Grub Overdose

My recreation of the boot screen from the game 'Needy Streamer Overload' as a GRUB theme.
Also known as 'Needy Girl Overdose'.

## Fonts

Fonts used are:

- IBM VGA 8x14, by [VileR](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/)
- IBM BIOS, by [VileR](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/)

## Installation

The theme can be installed just like any other grub theme.

1. Copy this repository to the `/boot/grub/themes/` directory.
2. Go to `etc/default/grub` and add the line `GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub/themes/needy-grub-overdose/theme.txt".`
   I personally like how the theme looks on my 1920x1080 screen with `GRUB_GFXMODE=1280x960` set as well.
3. Run `sudo update-grub`.
