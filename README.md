## Installation

The theme can be installed just like any other grub theme.

1. Copy this repository to the `/boot/grub/themes/` directory.
2. Go to `etc/default/grub` and add the line `GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub/themes/needy-grub-overdose/theme.txt".`
   On my 1920x1080 screen, I have `GRUB_GFXMODE=1280x960` set as well.
3. Run `sudo update-grub`.
